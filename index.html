            <h2>1. What is CAE?</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Crédito con Aval del Estado (CAE)</strong> is a student loan program created in Chile in 2005 
                to expand access to higher education. The system is financed by private banks, but the government 
                acts as a <strong>state guarantor</strong>, ensuring that students without financial collateral can still 
                access long-term educational loans.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Historical Background</h2>
            <p>
                During the early 2000s, Chile experienced a rapid increase in demand for higher education. 
                Universities and technical institutions expanded, but tuition costs rose sharply. Traditional 
                financing tools, including limited scholarship programs and small public loans, were insufficient 
                to support the growing number of students.
            </p>
            <p>
                In response, the Chilean government introduced CAE in 2005. Its goal was to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide large-scale financing to students from middle- and lower-income households.</li>
                    <li>Increase enrollment in universities and technical institutes.</li>
                    <li>Share financial risk between the state, private banks, and students.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="caption">The CAE program helped Chile achieve one of the highest college enrollment rates in Latin America.</p>

            <h2>3. Development and Evolution</h2>
            <p>
                Since its creation, CAE has undergone significant changes. Key developments include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>2006–2011:</strong> Rapid expansion of the program, with hundreds of thousands of new loans issued.</li>
                    <li><strong>2012:</strong> Nationwide student protests pushed the government to reduce interest rates and improve repayment terms.</li>
                    <li><strong>2016:</strong> Interest rates were capped at 2%, and repayment became income-dependent.</li>
                    <li><strong>2020s:</strong> CAE became a central topic in educational reform discussions, especially regarding debt relief and the role of banks.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="caption">Public debate about CAE has influenced multiple policy reforms over the last decade.</p>

            <h2>4. Future Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                Today, CAE faces several important challenges:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Debt Accumulation:</strong> Many graduates carry significant debt relative to their income, especially in low-paying fields.</li>
                <li><strong>Administrative Complexity:</strong> The involvement of private banks, state guarantees, and multiple repayment schemes makes the system difficult for students to navigate.</li>
                <li><strong>Equity Concerns:</strong> Students from lower-income families still rely disproportionately on loans rather than grants.</li>
                <li><strong>Reform Pressure:</strong> Policymakers continue to debate replacing CAE with a fully public financing system.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                As Chile advances toward new educational models, CAE remains a critical part of the conversation about how to 
                balance access, affordability, and long-term fiscal sustainability.
